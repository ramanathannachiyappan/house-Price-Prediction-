# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a basic Machine Learning model to predict house prices using historical housing data.  
It demonstrates the complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation using Python.

The project is intentionally kept simple to strengthen core Machine Learning fundamentals.

---

## Problem Statement
House prices depend on multiple factors such as property features and location-related attributes.  
The goal of this project is to analyze these factors and build a regression model that can predict house prices accurately.
